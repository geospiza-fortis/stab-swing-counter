## How it was done

- Video collection and testing methods
- Creating a training set
- Building a classification model
- Running inference on trial data
- Visualizing the output

In order to classify swings and stabs, we first need to collect some data. I did this in two parts. I took about 3 minutes of footage in the first video that I used to prototype the initial pipeline.
